# PopularMovies

The Popular Movies project is made and used for code reviewing in the Udacity Android Nanodegree course for Movie Project 1 & 2 phases. It is the functional project version based on the project requirements.

# Features
An app, optimized for tablets, to help users discover popular and highly rated movies on the web. It displays a scrolling grid of movie trailers, launches a details screen whenever a particular movie is selected, allows users to save favorites, play trailers, and read user reviews. This app utilizes core Android user interface components and fetches movie information using themoviedb.org web API.

# Installation
The project retrieves the movie data from The Movie Database. The app requires your API key (which you generated on The Movie Database) to work properly. When you obtain API key, replace YOUR_API_KEY with your API key in the api_key_value in res/values/strings file with your own key from themoviedb.org
```xml
<string name="api_key_value">your_api_key</string>
```
